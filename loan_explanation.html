    <h1>We oparate as a peer to peer community based system</h1>
    
    <p> 
        Our stokvel is built on community trust and shared financial growth. 
        Members contribute regularly to a collective fund, and that fund is used to 
        provide loans to members when needed. unlike banks, loans come directly from
        member contributions meaning members support each other. 
    </p>

    <h2>How a Stokvel lean works?</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Member contributions:</strong><br> each member contributes fixed amount weekly or monthly into a communal fund</li>
        <li><strong>Loan request:</strong><br> when a member needs financial assistance, they apply for a loan from the available funds</li>
        <li><strong> Approval process:</strong><br> loans are approves by admin according to the group's rules and available funds</li>
        <li><strong>Interest and growth:</strong><br> Loans include an agreed interest rate set by the group. The interest goes back
            into a share fund, helping it grow for the benefit of all members
        </li>
        <li><strong>Repayment:</strong><br> Members repay their loans within the agreed timeframe.
            Responsible repayment ensures the system remains sustainable and fair to everyone
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Capped amount:</strong><br> The amount that a member can loan is capped at  the amount that the member has
            saved + 30% of it.
        </li>
    </ol>


    <h3> Key principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Loans are funded by members not external lenders</li>
        <li>All rules and terms are defined in the group's constitution</li>
        <li>interest earned benefit the entire group</li>
        <li>The system is built on trust, transparency and accountability</li>
